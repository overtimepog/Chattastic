---- TODO ----
   ✅ Have the "!enter" command work for kick (COMPLETED)

   ✅ Add toggle between raffle mode and random picking for Kick (COMPLETED)

   ✅ replace the text insatances of emojis ie. [emote:name], with the actual corrisponding image in the webui and overlay, in any way possible (COMPLETED)

   ✅ have the overlay be more controllable from the webui, text color, spacing on all sides.. etc etc (COMPLETED)

   ✅ when in upwards mode, the overlays first message gets kind of cut off at the bottom, id like to be able to change to distance from the bottom of the browser source to where the message goes, in the web ui, let the user input what dimentions they're browser source is, and use that to auto adjust the text showing so it fits and looks good inside the dimentions the user gave (COMPLETED)

   create a new checkbox for the overlay, what id like is a new mode for the chat overlay, where instead of messages appear stacked on top of each other, they appear at random places across the browser source with an animation then they disapeer after a user setable time, also allow every aspect of this to be customizable from the webui
